					<h2>Three Examples</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Five years ago, mob programming was something we hadn’t heard about at ctm.
						Today, most teams have tried it
						and many have found that it helps them.</p>
						<p>Some have been doing it for years, some are still new to it.</p>
						<p>I’m going to tell the story of three teams that started mobbing
						What went well, what went not so well
						What was learned
						</p>
						<p>I’m hoping that these will encourage you to give mobbing a go, or if you already have, find ways to make your mobs even better.</p>
