					<h2>(Talk Structure)</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>Five years ago, mob programming was something we hadn’t heard about at ctm.
					Today, most teams have tried it
					and many have found that it helps them.</p>
					<p>Some have been doing it for years, some are still new to it.</p>
					<p>I’m going to tell the story of three teams that started mobbing
					What went well, what went not so well
					What was learned
					</p>
					<p>I’m hoping that these will encourage you to give mobbing a go, or if you already have, find ways to make your mobs even better.</p>

						<p>after: we make decisions as we go, everyone is here</p>
						
						<p>before: hard to keep code consistent, re naming</p>
						<p>after: we spot when someone is doing something different, have a conversation before it happens</p>
						
						<p>before: hard to keep quality consistently high with different skills/experiences in team, code reviews are tricky</p>

					<h1>(Difficulties 2)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<h3>Safety</h3>

					<h1>(Summary)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>we’ve learned how to mob</p>
						<p>and we love it</p>
						
						<p>Mobbing amplifies all the good things about pairing
						But if there are issues, these can be amplified too</p>
						
						<p>mobbing works by shortening feedback loops
						so we start to question some of our practices</p>
						<p>retros – we tend to bring things up in real-time instead</p>
						<p>code reviews – we’ve already review it</p>
