					<h2>(Talk Structure)</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Five years ago, mob programming was something we hadn’t heard about at ctm.
						Today, most teams have tried it
						and many have found that it helps them.</p>
						<p>Some have been doing it for years, some are still new to it.</p>
						<p>I’m going to tell the story of three teams that started mobbing
						What went well, what went not so well
						What was learned
						</p>
						<p>I’m hoping that these will encourage you to give mobbing a go, or if you already have, find ways to make your mobs even better.</p>

						<p>But we had some difficulties:</p>

						<p>Mobbing is intense</p>
						
						<h3>Tiredness</h3>

					<h1>(Difficulties 2)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<h3>Safety</h3>

				<section class="mob1">
					<h1>(Summary)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>we’ve learned how to mob</p>
						<p>and we love it</p>
						
						<p>Mobbing amplifies all the good things about pairing
						But if there are issues, these can be amplified too</p>
						
						<p>mobbing works by shortening feedback loops
						so we start to question some of our practices</p>
						<p>retros – we tend to bring things up in real-time instead</p>
						<p>code reviews – we’ve already review it</p>

					<h1>(solutions 2)</h1>

						<p>So now instead of always mobbing, we picked the right size team to each story
						And sometimes that would change as the story progressed.
						For example, a story might need everyone’s input to get going, but only a pair could finish it off.
						For example, someone may start what they thought was a simple story, but  find a gnarly problem and need a mob’s help.
